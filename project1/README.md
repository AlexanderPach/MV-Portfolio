Frontend Developers
- What job does it form for them?
Provides a backend that is connected to the Cat API; it provides CRUD abilities to handle data.
- What inspired you to make it?
Ideally, the project required building any CRUD Application using an API. I figured something simple such as Cat API would work, since I have a cat myself.
- What features are the most important?
I wanted to stay consistent to the MVP architecture so that the visualization of code is seperated which also makes it easy to run tests.
