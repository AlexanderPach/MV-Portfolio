## Project #3
- What are the users? <br>
It's for developers who want to integrate a CI/DI pipeline within their projects.
- What job does it form for them? <br>
Help improve software delivery by maintain the quality of your code much faster. This allows a quicker access to check how your code holds up.
- What inspired you to make it? <br>
The project guidelines had us focus on the CI/CD processs rather than fundamentally what the project is. I figured since this project was a gateway onto learning
CI/CD pipelines, that I should use a simple web development project that I can run test and continuous integrations on.
- What features are the most important? <br>
It's not the original repo, but the YAML files create a workflow provided by Github Actions.
